\subsection{Evolution and Refactoring}

In order to fulfil the requirements of the project, we have continuously evolved our system. When evolving a project over time, technical debt within the system may rise, making it harder to change existing functionality. In order to combat the technical debt, the team has applied software practices and pull requests and tested and refactored the code through each iteration. It has been necessary to have a high-quality codebase to implement the coming week's implementations without dealing with technical debt. As seen in previous projects, implementing new features or changing existing ones can become tedious without significant technical debt. As a team, we have felt the benefits of continuously trying to keep a high code quality, as implementing new features has not been a problem due to technical debt.
