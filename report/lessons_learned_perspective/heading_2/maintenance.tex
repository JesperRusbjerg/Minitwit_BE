\subsection{Maintenance}

The system has grown throughout the course, each iteration of implementation creating new challenges. To ensure the system functionality did not break, the team has kept track of the system's health. The tracking is monitored through the steps discussed in the pipeline section involving: Monitoring, Logging, Static analysis, and regression testing. Another significant indicator of the system health state has been to look at the simulator results every 3 hours, as it continuously has provided the team with feedback on the system's state. One of the biggest challenges we faced was to fix the bugs the simulator found within our codebase, as discussed in Section~\ref{stateofsystem}.
