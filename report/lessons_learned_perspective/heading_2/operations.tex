\subsection{Operations}

Creating the DevOps operations infrastructure has been much work for the team. However, there have not been any real roadblocks in implementing the DevOps functionality. There have been technologies that took a few days to get up and running, but the team has generally not been behind schedule. Joint ownership, continuous feedback, and always helping each other have been vital criteria for why the team was never overwhelmed with the amount of workload. Each component that the team implemented helped develop the system, the logging implementation was especially vital to find system improvements when the simulator detected errors. In addition to the logging, the CI pipeline was a great help to ensure that our system did not regress as the weekly implementations were integrated into the main branch.
