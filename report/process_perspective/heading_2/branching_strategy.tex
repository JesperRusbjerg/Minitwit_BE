\subsection{Applied Branching Strategy}

For the branching strategy, we used trunk based development \cite{trunkdev}. This strategy allowed all team members to review and better understand the code, helping find possible undesirable code sections such as code smells or potential bugs. This workflow also satisfies the second way of The Three Ways.
Furthermore, to make it even more clear as to what kind of code changes was made, we prefixed all our branches with one of the following

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item bugfix
  \item feature
  \item release
\end{itemize}
This approach made it clear what kind of changes the PR should address and allows running certain pipelines depending on the branch type.
