\subsection{Organization and Interaction of the Team}

The group consisted of five developers. All of us had interdisciplinary knowledge, namely understanding both the backend and the frontend, as well as having DevOps capabilities. Certainly, we had our preferences in terms of whether one pursued more frontend or backend development direction. When it comes to DevOps all the developers attempted to be equally engaged in the process. We tried to pair up in all kinds of development tasks to ensure a better quality of the outcome and better learning. We used a Discord channel to facilitate the communication, both co-coding sessions and asynchronous messaging.
