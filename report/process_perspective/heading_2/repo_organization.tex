\subsection{Organization of Repositories}

Throughout the development of our system, we have had two repositories. One contained all the code, documentation and other artefacts regarding the backend and one for the frontend. When we started the project, we created an organisation and created our two repositories within this organisation. However, approximately halfway through the project, we moved away from using this organisation because we encountered issues integrating Travis and Github when using the organisation.
