\subsection{Design and architecture of ITU-MiniTwit}

The architecture is depicted through UML diagrams conforming to the 3+1 architectural description. These are Module, Component-and-Connector and Allocation Views. Moreover, a Container Diagram is supplied to utilize the methodology of the C4model~\cite{c4model}. All graphs are contained in .xml files on the GitHub repository and can be reimported to the website~\cite{drawio} to make future changes~\cite{architecturalViews}. The following list enumerates services embedded within the project, therefore included in the diagrams:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item MiniTwit Vue.js Web Application
    \item MiniTwit .NET Application
    \item Prometheus
    \item Grafana
    \item DataDog Agent
    \item Database: MariaDB
\end{itemize}

Interactions among those is achieved with the support of the following technologies, frameworks, cloud providers and services:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item DigitalOcean (referred to as DO in later sections)
    \item Docker
    \item TravisCI
    \item SonarCloud
    \item Snyk - Docker Scan
