The deadly algorithm sla are a set of policies that obligates certain standards of our system to 
be upheld, and in case it cannot we will reimburse the wronged party. 

This sla includes the minitwit api and minitwit frontend.

## Monthly Uptime Percentage
less than 95% uptime  -> 10 credits of reimbursement
less than 99% but more than 95% uptime -> 5 credits of reimbursement

We calculates the uptime by (Number of successful request / Total number of request )

responsibility if third party services are down. This includes but are not limited to 
hosting, data retrieval, payment etc
